        Content

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The first topic of my site will be described within the homepage;
        There will be an introduction to freshwater fishing (for now this will be fishing for trout). 
        Beginner fisherman will visit this site to acquire information on how to start fishing for trout. 
        They will come with questions on different aspects of fishing like how, when, and where to catch freshwater fish.
        Question they may come with may be what is the cost of fishing? What equipment do they need to start? How to handle fish when caught? How to cast? etc. 
        This website will briefly cover all these things helping new fisherman learn the basics. 
        On the homepage there will be a collage of trout fishing pictures with a history of trout fishing underneath. 
        From this page visitors can then click on links to take them to either a page with info on equipment or on fishing locations within Idaho. 
        No information will be necessary to access the various feature of this site, however there will be an email subscription section for visitors to receive news from the site.
