                <p id="rrp">Trout fishing is a popular sport, but you need the right gear to successfully catch trout. From the best fishing line for trout to trout lures and more, there are plenty of options when it comes to trout fishing. The most important gear you will need to go fishing, however, is a fishing rod and reel.
                It would be pretty difficult to catch trout, or any fish, without a rod and reel. These fundamental pieces of equipment are complex, and some rods and reels are tailored specifically for trout fishing. Whether you prefer casting gear or spinning gear, find the best trout rod and reel to make your next great catch!<br>

                <h2 id="fl">Flies</h2>
                <p id="flp">Fishing flies are bait designed to imitate insects, invertebrates, baitfish, crustaceans, small animals, and other fish fodder.
                Traditionally, flies were “tied” with natural materials like feathers, thread, and animal fur or hair. Now, a range of synthetic and natural materials are used, sometimes on the same fly. Flies fall into roughly five categories: dry flies, wet flies, streamers, poppers, and saltwater flies.<br>
